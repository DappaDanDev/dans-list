# Dans List Development

## Developement Environemt
- We use Typescript and NextJS with a focus on clean architecture and test-driven development
- Test are created and they are the source of truth, we never use changes test to pass them. We pass the tests.
- We use extensive logging as a means to debug issues for any network or asycn calls.
- We use static typing with Typescript and run a linting and fix any type issues before running the code.
- We never use placeholders or dummy data in place of real data. Real data will always be used.
- Documentation and code samples are the law. We generate code that is based only on the given references.
- Every time we implement something new, we always write a plan out and then wait for approval before executing it.
